#PDC for PHP

>Smart little worker that checks on your PHP source code's class dependencies.

Packfire Dependency Checker (PDC) is a tiny tool to run and report on missing dependencies and files with missing namespace declaration in a [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) compliant PHP project. 

While most coding errors are reported, with the new autoloading in PHP 5.3, errors such as:

- Class dependencies linkage breaks after file renamed or moved
- Files contain naming mistake in namespaces or classes
- Problematic `use` statements
- Unused `use` statements

Some of these problems don't show up in tests or even in usage until manual check uncovers it. 

What PDC does is simply to iterate through all your PHP source code and inspect the `namespace`, `use`, and class usage statements in your code. 

You can run [PDC with your Travis-CI builds](http://packfire.tumblr.com/post/34222935980/github-gist-and-travis-ci-integration) and show the PDC report behind PHPUnit. 

##Requirements

- PHP 5.3 or higher

##Download

Download the PDC PHAR binary at [http://mauris.sg/bin/pdc.phar](http://mauris.sg/bin/pdc.phar).

##Usage

PDC is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. It does not have an graphical interface. To run PDC on your source code, simply add the path to the end of the arguments:

    $ php pdc.phar /path/to/src

An optional `bootstrap` parameter allows you to define the autoloader for PDC to perform additional checking.

    $ php pdc.phar --bootstrap=autoload.php src

If you use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), PDC will automatically detect `vendor/autoload.php` and automatically include the autoloader to give you a smoother experience.

To check multiple directories, use the PATH_SEPARATOR (i.e. ';') in your last parameter. The following example will check source code in both `src` and `test` directories. 

    $ php pdc.phar src;test

To run PDC in your Travis-CI builds, add the following into your `.travis.yml` file:

    after_script:
      - "wget --quiet http://mauris.sg/bin/pdc.phar && php pdc.phar src"
